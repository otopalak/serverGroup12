# Technologies
## Programming language and environment
* Java 15
* Springboot
* Gradle
* AWS

## Database management
* Hibernate
* JPA
* PostgreSQL

# High-level components
We have structured all our classes in controller, service and repository classes. Every API call to the backend is caught by the responding controller class and further processed in the given service class. The service class then references to a repository, where the final entity is saved. The repositories are all JPA-repositories, which mapps our entities via Hibernate to the database. By coppling our entities with the Mapping annotations of the Java persistence library, it makes the application less error-prone and makes deleting dependent entities in the databse easier.

# Launch & Deployment
## start the application
To start the server locally, just run the [server](https://github.com/sopra-fs21-group-12/serverGroup12) and the [client](https://github.com/sopra-fs21-group-12/clientGroup12) the server is reachable under http://localhost:8080/.

To start the deployed application on Heroku follow this [link](http://sopra-fs21-group-12-client.herokuapp.com/)

## dependencies and database
The PostgreSQL database is only used in the deployed build on Heroku. For testing we have used the H2 in-memory database.
Once a change is commited to the master-branch on GitHub, the application is automatically redeployed on Heroku. The deployment follows the steps defined in the properties file.

# Roadmap
* We would like to implement statistics on users and their items. These data would be used to develop a more sophisticated item Proposal, so that the match percentage of a user with a given item ca be increased
* implement a User rating, where you can rate the other user in terms of the swap process. This would increase trustworthyness of users.
* A swap History with all items you haved swapped so far should be displayed for every item.
* Further Google Maps implementations for a match, so that the route and route time is calculated to make the swap.
