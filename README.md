# SoPra RESTful Service Template FS21

# Introduction
Swap your belongings for something better!

The goal of this project was to create a trading plattform, however with a twist. Instead of having a boring and dull looking interface, the user is animated to swipe on other items, that he is interested in. In our application the user is able to upload multiple pictures, add a description, a title and is even able to set the location for his items, that he wants to trade with. Based on tags, that he chooses the user can then filter his suggestions for trading. The swiping is ingenious, letting him do this in a Tinder like fashion. If a match is created (two people liked eachothers items/want to trade them), the two users are then able to chat with eachother and negotiate the further trade.

# Technologies
## Programming language and environment
* Java 15
* Springboot
* Gradle
* AWS

## Database management
* Hibernate
* JPA
* PostgreSQL

# High-level components
We have structured all our classes in controller, service and repository classes. Every API call to the backend is caught by the responding controller class and further processed in the given service class. The service class then references to a repository, where the final entity is saved. The repositories are all JPA-repositories, which mapps our entities via Hibernate to the database. By coppling our entities with the Mapping annotations of the Java persistence library, it makes the application less error-prone and makes deleting dependent entities in the databse easier.

# Launch & Deployment
## start the application
To start the server locally, just run the [server](https://github.com/sopra-fs21-group-12/serverGroup12) and the [client](https://github.com/sopra-fs21-group-12/clientGroup12).
The server is then reachable under http://localhost:8080/.

To start the deployed application on Heroku follow this [link](http://sopra-fs21-group-12-client.herokuapp.com/)

## dependencies and database
The PostgreSQL database is only used in the deployed build on Heroku. For testing we have used the H2 in-memory database.
Once a change is commited to the master-branch on GitHub, the application is automatically redeployed on Heroku. The deployment follows the steps defined in the properties file.
Furhermore you can locally not upload any pictures. We have used a AWS S3 bucket for our pictures. To make sure the credentials are not openly available, they are saved as secrets on heroku. The same is done for the persistent database. 

# Roadmap
* We would like to implement statistics on users and their items. These data would be used to develop a more sophisticated item Proposal, so that the match percentage of a user with a given item ca be increased
* implement a User rating, where you can rate the other user in terms of the swap process. This would increase trustworthyness of users.
* A swap History with all items you haved swapped so far should be displayed for every item.
* Further Google Maps implementations for a match, so that the route and route time is calculated to make the swap.
